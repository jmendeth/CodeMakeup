# CodeMakeup

A collection of good-looking, wisely designed themes for the [CodeMirror editor](http://codemirror.net).

 * Ambiance2 (work-in-progress)
 * Woodance (work-in-progress)
 * [Dabbit](https://github.com/jmendeth/CodeMakeup-dabbit) (work-in-progress)

Every theme is on a submodule (separate repo).

Unless noted otherwise, the themes are licensed under the [2-clause BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license), see `LICENSE`.

### Licensing problems

Some themes contain textures or patterns that can pose  
licensing problems when trying to be shipped with CodeMirror.

In that case, this collection is a perfect place for them,  
as long as they are [Free Cultural Works](http://freedomdefined.org/Definition) (ask if you're unsure).
